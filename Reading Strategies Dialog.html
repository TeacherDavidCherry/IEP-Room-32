    <h1>Reading Strategies – Dialogue</h1>
    <div class="dialogue">
        <p><span class="student">Student:</span> I don’t get it. How do I even start reading something new?</p>
        <p><span class="teacher">Teacher:</span> If it feels overwhelming, calm down and focus on one small part at a time. Make it easy! Break sentences into smaller parts.</p>
        <p><span class="student">Student:</span> Break them up? Why?</p>
        <p><span class="teacher">Teacher:</span> It helps you focus. You don’t need to understand everything at once. Focus on one thing until you get it.</p>
        <p><span class="student">Student:</span> So, how do I know where to break a sentence?</p>
        <p><span class="teacher">Teacher:</span> Break it after commas or words like “and,” “but,” or “because.” It makes it easier to read.</p>
        <p><span class="student">Student:</span> Alright, cool. What’s next?</p>
        <p><span class="teacher">Teacher:</span> Next, look for context clues in the text. Words around the unknown word can help you guess its meaning.</p>
        <p><span class="student">Student:</span> Oh, like “It's a sport” helps me understand at least a little bit if they are talking about a new sport that I have never heard of before.</p>
        <p><span class="teacher">Teacher:</span> Exactly! And remember, Context clues are words, not pictures. Pictures can be clues, but when we say context clues, we mean words, not pictures. And remember that pictures aren’t always very good clues. Look at the words.</p>
        <p><span class="student">Student:</span> Got it! What else?</p>
        <p><span class="teacher">Teacher:</span> Use what you already know. If the text is about a sport you never heard of, and you know about other sports already, use that information to help understand this new sport better.</p>
        <p><span class="student">Student:</span> So I can use my general knowledge of sport to understand a text about a new sport better?</p>
        <p><span class="teacher">Teacher:</span> Yes! It’s making connections with what you already know.</p>
        <p><span class="student">Student:</span> That helps a lot! But what if I still don’t get the main idea?</p>
        <p><span class="teacher">Teacher:</span> That’s okay. Reread the section. Going over it again helps you understand better and catch things you missed.</p>
        <p><span class="student">Student:</span> So, reread if I don’t get it?</p>
        <p><span class="teacher">Teacher:</span> Exactly. And don’t forget, focus on the main idea, not every small detail. That’ll help you understand the text faster.</p>
        <p><span class="student">Student:</span> Right! And what about those tough words when I cannot guess the meaning from the rest of the text?</p>
        <p><span class="teacher">Teacher:</span> If you don’t understand a word, look it up. But try to guess first, then check with a dictionary if you’re still unsure.</p>
        <p><span class="student">Student:</span> So, don’t stop and look up every word?</p>
        <p><span class="teacher">Teacher:</span> That is correct! Guess first, then check to see if you were right. You should practice your other reading skills first instead of taking the easy way out and looking the new word up.</p>
        <p><span class="student">Student:</span> Okay, so break it up, look for clues, use what I know, reread, focus on the main idea, and after I have practiced my other skills, look words up to see if I was correct! Got it!</p>
        <p><span class="teacher">Teacher:</span> Exactly! You’re all set. Keep practicing, and reading will get easier each time.</p>
