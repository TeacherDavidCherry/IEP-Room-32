            <p>Last weekend was totally awesome for Jack. Best weekend ever. It was incredible!</p>
            <p>1. What did Jack and Tom do on Friday afternoon?</p>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q1" value="a"> Went skateboarding</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q1" value="b"> Played basketball</label>

        </div>

        <div class="story-text">
            <p>It all kicked off on Friday afternoon. Jack and his best friend, Tom, zoomed through their homework like superheroes on a mission. Math had no chance. Then they grabbed their basketball and headed to the park. Jack made three baskets in a row like a pro. Swish, swish, swish! Tom tried a fancy spin shot and missed twice. They laughed so hard he nearly dropped the ball. But who cares? They were having a blast.</p>
            <p>2. How did Jack feel about his basketball shots?</p>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q2" value="a"> Nervous</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q2" value="b"> Proud</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q2" value="c"> Angry</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q2" value="d"> Confused</label>
        </div>

        <div class="story-text">
            <p>3. What happened when Tom tried a fancy spin shot?</p>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q3" value="a"> He made the shot</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q3" value="b"> He missed twice and nearly dropped the ball</label>

            <label><input type="radio" name="q3" value="d"> He passed the ball to Jack</label>
        </div>

        <div class="story-text">
            <p>Saturday morning, Jack woke up feeling like something exciting was waiting—and he was right. His cousin Max called and said, "Dude, want to go skateboarding?" Jack had never tried it before. "Okay… okay," he said, already nervous.</p>
            <p>4. What was Jack’s reaction when Max called him to go skateboarding?</p>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q4" value="a"> He was excited</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q4" value="b"> He was nervous</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q4" value="c"> He refused</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q4" value="d"> He didn’t understand the question</label>
        </div>

        <div class="story-text">
            <p>At the skatepark, Jack stood up on the board like it was a wild animal. "Relax!" Max grinned. "Just ride it like a wave." Jack had no idea what that meant. He wobbled forward and nearly fell. But then Max cheered, "You got this!" That gave Jack superpowers or something, because suddenly he was zooming around like a turtle on wheels. Not fast, but moving!</p>
            <p>5. How did Jack feel when he first tried skateboarding?</p>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q5" value="a"> Confident</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q5" value="b"> Nervous and wobbly</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q5" value="c"> Excited</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q5" value="d"> Frustrated</label>
        </div>

        <div class="story-text">
            <p>6. What advice did Max give Jack while skateboarding?</p>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q6" value="a"> "Relax and ride it like a wave"</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q6" value="b"> "Try to go really fast"</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q6" value="c"> "You need special shoes"</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q6" value="d"> "Fall only once"</label>
        </div>

        <div class="story-text">
            <p>By afternoon, things got even better. They hit the beach! Max brought his surfboard, and Jack’s eyes got big. "Surfing? For real?" Max gave a 5-minute surfing lesson that mostly went, "Just don’t fall." Spoiler alert: Jack fell. A lot. But he kept going, and then, bam! He stood up on a wave. It was tiny, but to Jack, it felt like riding a dragon. He threw his hands up and yelled, "I’m flying!" before falling again, face-first into the water. Still worth it.</p>
            <p>7. What happened when Jack tried surfing for the first time?</p>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q7" value="a"> He caught a big wave immediately</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q7" value="b"> He fell many times but finally stood up</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q7" value="c"> He didn't fall at all</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q7" value="d"> He got scared and stopped</label>
        </div>

        <div class="story-text">
            <p>8. How did Jack feel when he finally stood up on the surfboard?</p>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q8" value="a"> Like riding a dragon</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q8" value="b"> Nervous and unsure</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q8" value="c"> Like a pro surfer</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q8" value="d"> Like he was going to fall again</label>
        </div>

        <div class="story-text">
            <p>That evening, Max’s family invited Jack to stay for dinner. They made spaghetti with meatballs—Jack’s favorite. And they had ice cream for dessert, three flavors! They laughed, told funny stories, and even had a spaghetti slurp contest. Max won, but just barely.</p>
            <p>9. What did Jack eat for dinner at Max’s house?</p>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q9" value="a"> Pizza</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q9" value="b"> Spaghetti with meatballs</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q9" value="c"> Hamburger</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q9" value="d"> Tacos</label>
        </div>

        <div class="story-text">
            <p>And then came Sunday. Surprise! Snow. Jack had never seen real snow before. He ran outside, jumped into a snowdrift, and yelled, "This is awesome!" Max’s parents took them to a nearby mountain where they tried skiing and snowboarding. Jack fell so many times he looked like a snowman with legs. But he got better each time, and Max was always there to help him up and shout, "Nice wipeout!"</p>
            <p>10. What new sports did Jack try over the weekend?</p>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q10" value="a"> Baseball and tennis</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q10" value="b"> Skateboarding, surfing, and snowboarding</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q10" value="c"> Football and volleyball</label>

        </div>

        <div class="story-text">
            <p>That night, they sat by the fire with hot chocolate, wrapped in fuzzy blankets. They talked about sports. Max was into hockey and volleyball, while Jack said basketball was still his number-one favorite. But now, he had new favorites too: surfing, snowboarding, and hanging out with Max.</p>
            <p>13. What did Max and Jack talk about while sitting by the fire?</p>

        </div>

        <div class="story-text">
            <p>Max grinned. "You're my best friend, you know that?" Jack smiled back. "You too, bro." High five!</p>
            <p>14. How did Jack feel when he left Max's house on Sunday night?</p>

        <div class="story-text">
            <p>On Sunday night, Jack went home still wearing his snow hat and a big smile. He already missed Max, but he felt like the luckiest kid ever. He learned cool new sports, had tons of fun, and made memories that would last forever.</p>
            <p>15. What did Max say to Jack at the end of the weekend?</p>
